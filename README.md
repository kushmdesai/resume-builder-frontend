## About

Resume Builder the best way to build your resume on the web. I actually looked into building a Resume earlier and I found that almost all resume builders on the web required you to either pay money for download or to remove a watermark. I also noticed that after I tried out some more webstites I got more spam emails and I connected the dots to realize that maybe they were selling my data. I immedietly stopped using these website and decided to solve this problem.

Resume Builder relies on localstorage and no backend calls which means a perfectly safe environment for you. Another byproduct of this is speed because it does not rely on any backend it improves the speed drasticly.
